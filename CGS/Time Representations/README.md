How do we represent time?

* as frames in an animation or discrete simulation. These frames can be sped up or slowed down depending on your needs. 

* different phenomena have different time scales (color representation vs. languge representation).

* as a circle, as a flat timeline, as a network? These will be culturally-specific.

Using the flow of time at different rates (similar to SimCity):

* flow proceeds, can be sped up or slowed down (in physical world, time flows).

* "quasi-universal" representation (links culture and computation).

Using a flow of time that is circular, nonlinear:

* flow is relative to repeating events (recurrence).

* can we derive a quasi-universal model? Does time flow according to physics? Depends on the simulation world.
