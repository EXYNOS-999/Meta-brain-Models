How do we represent time?

* as frames in an animation or discrete simulation. These frames can be sped up or slowed down depending on your needs. 

* different phenomena have different time scales (color representation vs. languge representation).

* as a circle, as a flat timeline, as a network? These will be culturally-specific.
