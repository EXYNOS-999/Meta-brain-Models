## Allostasis machines

Allostasis as dynamics.

* what shifts systems to new homeostatic states (set points)?

Allostatic drive as differentiation.

* learn-unlearn-relearn (switching) as induction of allostatic drive.

* tree representation of states, as a map between stable homeostatic states (internal models) and external switches.

How does a network of neurons respond to a stressor?
