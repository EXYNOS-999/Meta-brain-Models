__NOTES__

A representational layer for developmental [Braitenberg Vehicles (BVs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle). Contextual Geometric Structure (CGS) kernels can be used to represent either individual nodes of the BV nervous system, distinct modules (groups of interconnected nodes), or the entire nervous system. This allows for BVs to be more reflective in generating the behaviors described for each vehicle type in [Braitenberg (1984)](https://books.google.com/books/about/Vehicles.html?id=7KkUAT_q_sQC).
