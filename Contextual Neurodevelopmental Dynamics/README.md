A representational layer for developmental [Braitenberg Vehicles (BVs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle). Contextual Geometric Structure (CGS) kernels can be used to represent either individual nodes of the BV nervous system, distinct modules (groups of interconnected nodes), or the entire nervous system. This allows for BVs to be more reflective in generating the behaviors described for each vehicle type in [Braitenberg (1984)](https://books.google.com/books/about/Vehicles.html?id=7KkUAT_q_sQC).  

In this instance of a meta-brain model, the brain is divided into two layers: the classic Braitenberg Vehicle and the CGS kernel. The BV consists of a body with sensors and information processing via connections between sensor and effector, and is analogous to the limbic system of the mammalian brain. By contrast, the CGS kernel provides a representational layer that is analogous to the mammalian neocortex or avian pallium.
