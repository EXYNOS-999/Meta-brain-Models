## Abstract

As a simulation technique, connectionism has allowed us to make great advances in artificial pattern recognition and category learning [1]. However, there are an entire class of problems in cultural evolution that can be addressed by introducing a modified version of a connectionist architecture [2]. We introduce a three-layer representation that processes empirical events through an ideological lens. To represent historical durability [3], cultural structures constrain beliefs, which in turn constrain a response to the empirical world. Beliefs themselves are used to shape decision-making on observed empirical states in a manner similar to Dempster-Shafer theory [4]. This kernel can be used to model suboptimal behavioral contribution to game theory models, or as a behavioral kernel to a meta-brain model.
